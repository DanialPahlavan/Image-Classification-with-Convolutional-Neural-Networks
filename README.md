# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
This project uses Python and scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on several features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset, which contains information about the median house values, the number of rooms, the number of bedrooms, the population, and other features of various districts in California.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and scikit-learn library installed. You can install scikit-learn using pip:
```
pip install scikit-learn
```

# Usage
To run the project, simply run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The output should show the accuracy score of the linear regression model.
