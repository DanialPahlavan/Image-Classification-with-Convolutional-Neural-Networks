# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
This project uses Python and Keras library to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cats and Dogs dataset, which contains 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is available for download from Microsoft Research website.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and scikit-learn library installed. You can install scikit-learn using pip:
```
pip install scikit-learn
```

# Usage
To run the project, simply run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The output should show the accuracy score of the linear regression model.
